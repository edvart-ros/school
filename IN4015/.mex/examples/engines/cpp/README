The files in this directory are:
1. cppEngineVariadicFeval
2. cppEngineVariadicFevalAsync

The cppEngineVariadicFeval file is a sample C++ program that uses the MATLAB Engine to call MATLAB functions and print the returned output. It uses the feval function to invoke MATLAB functions.
The cppEngineVariadicFevalAsync file is a sample C++ program that uses the MATLAB Engine to call MATLAB function asynchronously and prints the returned output. It uses the fevalAsync function to invoke MATLAB functions.

You can use the following commands to build and test the examples:
In the below example, replace <matlabroot> with the value returned by the "matlabroot" command in MATLAB.

On Windows:
-----------
Compile:
mex -client engine cppEngineVariadicFeval.cpp
mex -client engine cppEngineVariadicFevalAsync.cpp

To run the example applications, you need to add the following path to the PATH variable:
<matlabroot>\extern\bin\win64

Change path each time you run the application
To set the run-time library path from the Windows command prompt, type the following command. Set the path every time you open the Windows Command Processor.

set PATH=<matlabroot>\extern\bin\win64;%PATH%

To permanently change path

Windows 10:
In Search, search for and then select: System (Control Panel)
Click Advanced system settings > Advanced tab.
Click Environment Variables.
Under System variables, select Path and click Edit.
Modify Path by inserting <matlabroot>\extern\bin\win64; at the beginning of the Variable value.
Click Ok to close the dialog boxes, then close the Control Panel dialog box.

Run:
Navigate to the cppEngineVariadicFeval executable and execute the program
cd <matlabroot>/extern/examples/engines/cpp/
./cppEngineVariadicFeval

Navigate to the cppEngineVariadicFevalAsync executable and execute the program
cd <matlabroot>/extern/examples/engines/cpp/
./cppEngineVariadicFevalAsync


On Mac:
-----------
Compile:
mex -client engine cppEngineVariadicFeval.cpp
mex -client engine cppEngineVariadicFevalAsync.cpp

To run the example applications, add <matlabroot>/extern/bin/<macos> to DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH variable. Replace <macos> with either maca64 for macOS with Apple silicon or maci64 for macOS with Intel. 

To add "<matlabroot>/extern/bin/<macos>" to the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH variable:
C Shell
setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH <matlabroot>/extern/bin/<macos>

You can place these commands in a startup script, such as ~/.cshrc.
Bourne Shell
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=<matlabroot>/extern/bin/<macos>:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

Run:
Navigate to the cppEngineVariadicFeval executable and execute the program
cd <matlabroot>/extern/examples/engines/cpp/
./cppEngineVariadicFeval

Navigate to the cppEngineVariadicFevalAsync executable and execute the program
cd <matlabroot>/extern/examples/engines/cpp/
./cppEngineVariadicFevalAsync


On Linux:
-----------
Compile:
mex -client engine cppEngineVariadicFeval.cpp
mex -client engine cppEngineVariadicFevalAsync.cpp

In order run the example applications, add the following paths to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable:
<matlabroot>/sys/os/glnxa64
<matlabroot>/extern/bin/glnxa64

C Shell
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH <matlabroot>/extern/bin/glnxa64:<matlabroot>/sys/os/glnxa64

You can place these commands in a startup script, such as ~/.cshrc.

Bourne Shell
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<matlabroot>/extern/bin/glnxa64:<matlabroot>/sys/os/glnxa64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

You can place these commands in a startup script such as ~/.profile.

Run:
Navigate to the cppEngineVariadicFeval executable and execute the program
cd <matlabroot>/extern/examples/engines/cpp/
./cppEngineVariadicFeval

Navigate to the cppEngineVariadicFevalAsync executable and execute the program
cd <matlabroot>/extern/examples/engines/cpp/
./cppEngineVariadicFevalAsync
